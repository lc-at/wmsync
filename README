WMSYNC
------
A program used to synchronize Telkom Indonesia's WMS internet connection. 
Synchronization that I meant is simply just sending a login request in forever loop.
This is my first C project.

I decided to not continue the development of this project. In my perspective,
this project will be less usable if it is developed in C because the WMS's
autologin mechanism is constantly changing. I think it is better to develop
the project in a scripting language like Python. Constantly following the mechanism
change will be overwhelming and may take quite a long time.
Also, the development of this project has satisfied my learning needs. I have
learned many C things thanks to this project.
If you want to correct my code or give an advice, feel free to submit a pull request.
I will be very happy to learn.

Anyway, I plan to remake this project in Python.
